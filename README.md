- 👋 Hi, I’m @JanKoutek, student and sort of mad-web scientist from Czech republic.
- 👀 I’m interested in TV productions, public safety and how can web development help it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning tv broadcasting and webistes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ? Nothing. I´m just enjoying myself. 
- 📫 How to reach me ? Easy, just write me an email: koutekjan@seznam.cz
